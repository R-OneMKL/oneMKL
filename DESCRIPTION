Description: The `oneMKL` package establishes the connection between the R environment and 
  Intel oneAPI Math Kernel Library (`oneMKL`) for the `oneMKL.MatrixCal` package. To enable 
  the integration, the `oneMKL` package provides necessary header files and dynamic library 
  files to R, and imported files from the packages `mkl`, `mkl-include`, and `intel-openmp` 
  within `Anaconda`. It is important to note that the `oneMKL` and ` oneMKL.MatrixCal` 
  packages are only compatible with Windows and Linux operating systems due to the limitations 
  of Intel `oneMKL`.
