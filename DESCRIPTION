Description: The "oneMKL" package establishes the connection between the R environment 
  and Intel oneAPI Math Kernel Library ("oneMKL"), a prerequisite of using 
  "oneMKL.MatrixCal" package. Specifically, "oneMKL" provides necessary header 
  files and dynamic library files to R, and imports files from the packages 
  "mkl", "mkl-include", and "intel-openmp" from "Anaconda". The "oneMKL" and 
  "oneMKL.MatrixCal" packages are only compatible with Windows and Linux 
  operating systems due to Intel "oneMKL" limitations.
